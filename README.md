## Introduction

Heartbeat classification is critical in detecting abnormal heartbeats, such as arrhythmias. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify heartbeats into normal and abnormal categories using labeled heartbeat data.


## Project Overview

This notebook provides step-by-step instructions on how to build a classification model for heartbeat data. It covers the following:

- Preprocessing of the data
- Feature engineering
- Model training and testing
- Model evaluation with accuracy and other metrics



## Model Architecture

This project uses a supervised machine learning model for heartbeat classification. The specific architecture is as follows:

- Model type (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network)
- Layers or key components (if applicable)
